# RubyMine stuff
[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is basically the best IDE the world has ever seen, and my adorations for it are immeasurable. I share with you here those which take the form of docs, data, or code.

## [File Watchers](/file-watchers)
With version 6, RubyMine introduced the 'file watchers' system, which helps automate things like asset compilation (SASS, CoffeeScript, etc). You can create your own, so I've included the necessary information for reproducing the ones I've made in simple YAML files. In the near future I'll make a script that installs file watchers from such data.
